The Deadpool Quiz is an interactive website that allows users to join a quiz based on the movie famous and comic character "Deadpool". It is a simple but intreresting game that is user friendly and even a little informative for the user.
The Website has been built to be fully responsive across all devices but is essentially a mobile quiz game.

## Purpose

The purpose of the website is to produce a user-friendly quiz game dedicated to Deadpool. Being engaging and educational while also being replayable for the users that didn't get it right the first time.  

## User-Experience
I wanted the website to be aesthetically pleasing while using colours that are related to the Deadpool character. I wanted to keep the design minimal to not overwhelm the user while still being enjoyable to look at.
I wanted the user to be able to jusmp straight into the quiz with minimal navigation or extra pages blocking their path.

## Features

### Potential Future Features

- A Timer  
      - A running timer during the activity could add some pressure and excitment to the challenge. Making the user more likely to continue replayability.

- Online Leaderboard
      - I would like to make the Leaderboard work and host online, this would connect more users and add even more challenge once more questions were added.

- Contact the Developer
      - This would be a way that the user could give more ideas on extra questions, or a way for them to report any bugs that they may have found.


## Design

### Colour
- I decided to use a very simple style and go with the colours related to the main character of the quiz. These are big redish colours and of course black. Very basic but they work well together and I felt that not much other colours where needed for this quiz to stand out.

- I downloaded the main logo of my website and added it as an immage to [Coolers](https://coolers.co/) and it generated a palate for me to use that were similar to the logo.
This kept the theme of the quiz throughout my website.

### Fonts/Typography
Throughout this website I decided to use the Merriweather font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). This was done as it creates an almost serious tone to the words even though it is a fun and silly quiz. This juxtaposition was what I had in mind when creating some of the smaller parts.

### Initial Wireframe Plans

- Originally I was going to have a Yes/No type quiz about Deadpool, So when it was drawn up on paper initially, it looked similar to how it turned out in the end product.

I was always planning on going with the colour scheme you see on the website, I think it turned out well.
